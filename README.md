# 🛒 **Inventa – Voice-Enabled Inventory for Indian Grocery Stores**

*A modern, intuitive way for India’s kirana shops & city marts to manage stock — hands-free, stress-free.*

---

## 🌟 **Overview**

Inventa is a **voice-first inventory web app** designed for India’s most hard-working businesses — grocery shops, kirana stores, mini-marts, and wholesale outlets.

Shop owners can simply **speak in Hindi, English, or Hinglish** to update items, check quantities, and receive low-stock alerts.
No typing. No learning curve. No complex screens.

> **Inventa turns everyday inventory work into a simple conversation.**

## 🎯 **Why This Problem Matters**

Indian grocery stores operate in chaos — customers flowing in, goods being unloaded, payments happening simultaneously, and owners juggling dozens of SKUs from atta to dairy to snacks.

But existing tools fail because they are:

* ❌ Too cluttered
* ❌ Not language-friendly
* ❌ Hard to use during rush hours
* ❌ Made for offices, not shops
* ❌ Unreliable on low-end Android phones
* ❌ Not designed for India’s multilingual reality

Inventa solves these challenges by removing friction and bringing **human-centered simplicity** to one of India’s biggest retail segments.

## 💡 **What Inventa Does**

Inventa blends **voice, simplicity, and smart automation** to help shopkeepers stay in control without slowing down.

Shop owners can say things like:

* **“Aashirvaad atta 2 packet add kar do.”**
* **“Fortune oil ka stock kitna bacha?”**
* **“Maggi 4 packet minus kar do.”**

And Inventa handles the rest — updating stock, alerting low quantities, and logging every change neatly.
